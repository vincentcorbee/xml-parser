      to copy and modify this collection in any way for internal use within a
      company or organization. Permission is granted to redistribute the file
      <code>xmltest.zip</code> containing this collection to third parties

      that permission to distribute the collection in any other form is not
      granted.
    </p>

    <p>The collection is structured into three directories:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>not-wf</code></dt>
      <dd>this contains cases that are not well-formed XML documents</dd>
      <dt><code>valid</code></dt>
      <dd>this contains cases that are valid XML documents</dd>
      <dt><code>invalid</code></dt>
      <dd>
        this contains cases that are well-formed XML documents but are not valid
        XML documents
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The <code>not-wf</code> and <code>valid</code> directories each have three
      subdirectories:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <code>sa</code>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        this contains cases that are standalone (as defined in XML) and do not
        have references to external general entities
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <code>ext-sa</code>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        this contains case that are standalone and have references to external
        general entities
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <code>not-sa</code>
      </dt>

      <dd>this contains cases that are not standalone</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      In each directory, files with a <code>.xml</code> extension are the XML
      document test cases, and files with a <code>.ent</code> extension are
      external entities referenced by the test cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within the <code>valid</code> directory, each of these three
      subdirectories has an <code>out</code> subdirectory which contains an
      equivalent <a href="canonxml.html">canonical XML</a> document for each of
      the cases.
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Bug reports and contributions of new test cases are welcome.</p>
